## Getting Started

* Create a new repository in GitHub called Basic-Portfolio.
* Clone this repository to your computer using the process we went over in class.
* Navigate to the Basic-Portfolio folder that you just cloned onto your machine. Inside this folder,       create the following:

* HTML documents: index.html, contact.html and portfolio.html.
* A folder called assets.
* Inside the assets directory, make two additional folders: css and images.

* In the css folder, make a file called style.css.
* In the images folder, save the images you plan on using (like your profile image and the placeholder     images for the portfolio).

* Push the above changes to GitHub.
* Make sure to git add . and git commit -m "initial site files". Then type git push origin master to       push your changes to your GitHub repo.
